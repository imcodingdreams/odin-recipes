    <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>Rotisserie chicken is the time-saving secret to this mash-up of two crowd-pleasing foods. Stuff corn tortillas with a cheesy Buffalo filling and bake until melted for an easy weeknight meal or game day snack that's ready in a half hour.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus more for greasing the pan</li>
        <li>4 cups shredded rotisserie chicken</li>  
        <li>8 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar</li>  
        <li>1 cup Buffalo-style hot sauce, plus more for serving</li>  
        <li>1 bunch scallions, thinly sliced, white and green parts separated</li> 
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>16 corn tortillas</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons crumbled blue cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons blue cheese dressing</li>
      </ul>
     <h3>Steps:</h3> 
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Butter a 9-by-13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Mix the chicken, cream cheese, 1 cup of the Cheddar, 1/3 cup of the hot sauce, white parts of the scallions and cumin in a large bowl until well combined. Stir together the butter, remaining 2/3 cup hot sauce and 3 tablespoons water in a medium bowl.</li>  
        <li>Spoon a portion of the chicken mixture down the middle of each tortilla and roll up. Place them side by side, seam-side down, in the prepared pan. Pour the hot sauce mixture over the tortillas. Sprinkle with the remaining 1 cup Cheddar and the blue cheese and bake until the cheese is melted and bubbly, 15 to 17 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the blue cheese dressing over the enchiladas and sprinkle with the scallion greens. Serve with more hot sauce.</li>
      </ol>
